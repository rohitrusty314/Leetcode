EXAMPLES, and stratgey missing for functions



q2
Animation stuck at the edge

World lowercase - answered should be uppercase
color as String - incorrect
How core bounce was handled? Answered


q2
changes made for q2? Answered well
Constructor template incorrect
mx, my interpretation can be improved 
jerkless drag - explained well
How black dot was drawn on the scene? Answered

Function names need to be improved - 
Contracct, purpose statemen, examples  missing 



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CCS ID: linghanx

q1
Data def? color as string - has separate defs, can be used in a better way
Doddad-star in world, defined doddad
How core bounce was handled? Answered well
core-bounce function too long - readability can be improved by breaking into helpers


q2
Changes made from q1 - answered well
world-after-mouse-event: explained well
examples, and strategy missing - doddad-after-drag
How black dot was managed? answered well
on c key event only selected doddad should change color - both doddads are changing color




CCS ID: aman11
q1
Data def explanation - 
Observer template is commented
Color as String - Not any string is acceptable
Non-neg int as center for doddad - will not be non-neg int always
Function too long - act-according-cond - function not readable
Repeated code - can it be improved? 

q2
80 char width limit crossed
What outline chosen for the star? answered
Incomplete test coverage. - unable to 
Explain Data def - changes made - answered
How jerkless drag implemented? Answered
Approach for drawing the black dot? 
call-star, doddad-tx, etc contract incorrect, mistake is repeated 
Interpretation: doddad - saving mouse coordinates for every mouse action? unanswered
Follow-up: when the values get updated? answered
Function name not according style guide - name should be what is returned as output

data def?  
World take star and square - made mystar and mysquare

doddad explained as itemisation - incorrect explanation - it is mixed

Doddad observer template incorrect
mystar vx and vy as RealNum,
 
doddad has mySquare - square
how core bounce?  Explained
beyond-right function too long
two stars - no square

use constants 

q2:
changes made? explained
selected-x interpretation can be improved

jerkless drag - is jerky
world-after-drag can be broken to helpers
examples and strategy missing from helper functions
given is missing

q2
incomplete q2



CCS ID: marcotte628

q1
Data def? 
Template paranthese - missing for before and after function

doddad - color of type string

>>>>>

q1
Color 
incorrect casing 
possible values are not string
observer template missing - not evident

doodad casing is incorrect
doodad has color field of type String - should be color as defined above
crossing 80 char width limit
examples and strategy missing from functions - new-doodad
next-color explanation - contract inconsistent 


q2
jerkless drag? 
black dot lags while following when mouse is moved in some cases?
required followups to explain what's going on
What conditions are being checked - initially confused - should understand and be able to understand the program

Data type, circle1, naming convention not followed
incomplete test coverage
circle1-after-mouse-event
Examples missing
strategy missing

interpretated paused? but filed is paused-stat?
observer template for world incorrect - world-paused-stat?
doddad observer template
given missing : world-to-scene

q2
program throws an error check location
incomplete test converage
jerkless drag not implemented
black dot does not appear
world, doddad constructor template - field mismatch
several typos
given, examples and strategies missing - desing recipe not followed

q1:
80 char width crossed
color change order
data def? explained
Followup: why two structs? explained

792 - can any color be passed - it it will cause the program to crash - 
	- replied an error message can be passed back - violates the contract 
	

	
	
q2
jerkless dragging? needed followup - explained
requiring picturing-programs - for selecting radial star
constructor template has inconsistent with the fields with struct





CCS ID: 4kshay
>>>>>>
q1

data def? explained well
Color template missing
toggle-color function name can be improved
few test cases don't have a failure message.


q2
MX, MY - casing is not consistent - not data types - student's answer
